# CDEvents #

## What is this? ##
It's an Objective-C wrapper for Mac OS X's [FSEvents C API](http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/FSEvents_Ref/FSEvents_h/index.html). Inspired and based upon the ([MIT-licensed]((http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)) open source project [SCEvents](http://stuconnolly.com/projects/code/) created by [Stuart Connolly](http://stuconnolly.com/).

## Requirements ##
Requires Mac OS X 10.5, since FSEvents were introduced in 10.5, and an Intel CPU. Supports both manual memory management and garbage collection.

## What differentiates CDEvents from SCEvents then? ##
Not all that much but a litle. First of all all classes and protocols are prefixed with `CD` instead of `SC`, I hope that won't be to hard to remember? Secondly `CDEvent` (the event data wrapper-class) is immutable in contrast to `SCEvent` which is mutable. The next reason, this is the initial reason why I decided to rewrite `SCEvents`, being that the class `SCEvents`' is a singleton. I couldn't find a good reason as to why it had been designed this way and for my project an ordinary `alloc`/`init` route would be a better choise.

Another difference between `CDEvents` and `SCEvents` is that `CDEvents` is available for both manual memory management and environments using garbage collection.

So I've some of the code from scratch and taken some from `SCEvents`.
